## Install

```sh
npm install --save solids preact-solids
```

## Use
Inside your Preact components, import the `preact-solids` component you want to use and use it in the JSX. Assuming you are not using CSS Modules, you also import the styles from `solids` that correspond with the components you are using. Don't forget to import `solids/solids` and render the `solids` context element:

```js
import { h } from 'preact'
import AppBar from 'preact-solids/appbar'
import 'solids/solids'
import 'solids/appbar'

export const MyComponent = (props) => (
  <div class="solids">
    <AppBar prominent fixed shrink>
      <p>AppBar</p>
    </AppBar>
  </div>
)
```

If you are using CSS Modules, you should make sure that you import all your solids components in one place and use that import as a theme provider:

*routes/home/index.js*
```js
import { h } from 'preact';
import { Provider } from 'preact-solids/theme';
import AppBar from 'preact-solids/appbar';
import classes from './style';

export const Home = () => (
	<Provider value={{ classes }}>
		<AppBar>
			<p>Solids</p>
		</AppBar>
	</Provider>
);

export default Home;
```

*routes/home/styles.scss*
```scss
@import "solids/solids";
@import 'solids/appbar';

/* other styles */
```

Preact solids components load the default class names from solids, but listen for alternatives using a Theme consumer. If such alternatives are supplied to the components using a Theme provider like in the example above, it will use those class names instead of the defaults.

For now, have a look at the [solids-www](https://github.com/download/solids-www) project for some examples on how to use `solids` and `preact-solids` components in an app generated with [Preact CLI](https://github.com/developit/preact-cli).
